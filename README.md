# django_app_with_models

This is a simple Django App that has a model

## Here I am created a virtual environment called env

## I also created a django project with my zuri Board ID

## I now created an App called blog

## I also added the app to my main_project installed APP

## I created a model for my blog app called Post and added all the fields I need.

## I made a migration to add the fields to the migration file.
